Having a vision of a puzzle game where the player can think thoroughly or act quickly, I started this project. A physics game that incorporate kinematics and mechanic forces. Despite of the uncommon concept I hope the game will be fun and find it's audience.

Project's platform is Android OS but I'm using and developing with libgdx library, making it possible to run on desktop and browser. For physics I use box2d library.
